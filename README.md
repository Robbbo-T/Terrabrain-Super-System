1. Integration and Testing of Independent Modules

Objective: Set up comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the robustness of the Decision-Making Module (DM), Contextual AI Module (CAA), and Learning and Adaptation Module (LAM).

1.1 Unit Testing for Core Modules

Recommendations:

   •   Unit Tests: Validate the functionality of individual components, such as functions and classes, within each module.
   •   Integration Tests: Verify that modules interact correctly, ensuring data flows smoothly between different components without errors.

Example: Unit Test for DecisionMaker Class
